# WhatsThePassword

### (A.K.A) Password Generator
This cool tool written in Java FX helps you to create a custom to-brute-force wordlist for a person based on his general public details 
like name, age, spouse's name, birthday, etc.

### How to use
You just need to enter basic details of a person- his name, age, sex, birthday, etc. -You can look up in social media for those and 
then just click on ` Iniciar la nave Nodriza ` which pretty much means  ` Start Mothership `in Spanish
    
It's going to ask you internet permission and then it will generate the wordlist .You will be notified once it's done
So  I wanna wish you:
           **Happy Hacking !**
